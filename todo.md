#ToDo

- Clean up functions in NewTab.js, move the block functions to dif files
- Add a "tabs" option for settings. Move the humanLabel to the middle and have three boxes below, simpler design. Maybe make the selcted one black with white text?
- Figure out why googlephotosblock isnt adding multiple albums when displayting, it just displays from the first
